## Overview

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically build a Debian root filesystem for the Xiaomi Pad 6S Pro (sheng), providing a flashable `rootfs.img` and `boot.img`.  
Simply start a workflow in your own repository and you will have a ready-to-use Debian environment.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork & Enable Actions

Click the **Fork** button at the top right to copy the repository to your GitHub account.

Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your forked repository.  
If Actions are disabled, click `I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them`.

### 2. Run the Build Workflow

In the **Actions** page, select **"Build RootFS"** from the left sidebar, then click the **Run workflow** dropdown on the right.

You will see a list of configurable options (see [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration) for details).  
If you leave everything unchanged, the build will proceed with the **default settings**.

Click the green **Run workflow** button to start the build.

### 3. Download Artifacts

Once the workflow finishes, open the summary page of that run.  
Under the **Artifacts** section, download `rootfs.img` and `boot.img`.

## Advanced Configuration

When you trigger the **Build RootFS** workflow via `workflow_dispatch`, the following inputs are available:

| Parameter | Description | Options | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Debian Version** | Debian version to install (Trixie = Debian 13, Forky = Debian 14) | `trixie` / `forky` | `trixie` |
| **Desktop Environment** | Preinstalled desktop environment. Select `server` for a headless (no GUI) system. | `GNOME` / `KDE Plasma` / `server` | `KDE Plasma` |
| **Plasma Mobile** | Install `plasma-mobile` instead of `plasma-desktop` when Desktop Environment is `KDE Plasma`. | `true` / `false` | `false` |
| **Autologin** | Whether the created user should be logged in automatically. | `true` / `false` | `true` |
| **Username** | Username for the non-root user. | string | `username` |
| **Hostname** | System hostname. | string | `xiaomi-sheng` |
| **System language** | System locale for the generated root filesystem. Selecting `None (C.UTF-8)` keeps the default locale; selecting another option generates that locale together with `en_US.UTF-8` and sets it as the system default. | `None (C.UTF-8)` / `en_US.UTF-8` / `zh_CN.UTF-8` / `zh_TW.UTF-8` / `ja_JP.UTF-8` / `ko_KR.UTF-8` / `de_DE.UTF-8` / `fr_FR.UTF-8` / `es_ES.UTF-8` / `ru_RU.UTF-8` | `None (C.UTF-8)` |
| **Boot mode** | Determines which partition Debian boots from. See the [Flashing](#flashing-to-your-device) section for details. | `single (userdata)` – use the entire `userdata` partition; <br> `dual (linux)` – use a dedicated `linux` partition (dual boot); <br> `custom` – use a custom partition name (must be specified below) | `dual (linux)` |
| **Quiet boot** | Enables a quieter boot flow with Plymouth splash support. For prebuilt kernels, this selects the `_plymouth.img` boot image; for custom kernels, it appends `quiet splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles fbcon=map:1` to the boot cmdline. This is ignored when Desktop Environment is set to `server`. | `true` / `false` | `true` |
| **Custom partition** | Partition name to flash the rootfs to. **Required only when Boot mode is `custom`.** | any partition name (e.g. `debian`) | *(empty)* |
| **Kernel source** | How to obtain the kernel image. **`prebuilt` is not available when Boot mode is `custom`.** | `prebuilt` – use a prebuilt kernel from [ianchb/sm8550-mainline](https://github.com/ianchb/sm8550-mainline); <br> `custom_build` – clone and compile a custom kernel from the repo specified below | `prebuilt` |
| **Kernel Repo URL** | Git repository URL for the custom kernel. **Required when kernel source is `custom_build`.** | valid Git URL | `https://github.com/ianchb/sm8550-mainline` |
| **Kernel Branch** | Branch to checkout from the kernel repository. **Required when kernel source is `custom_build`.** | branch name | `sheng-7.2.6` |
| **Kernel Config** | Kernel config file name inside the repository. **Required when kernel source is `custom_build`.** | file name (e.g. `sm8550.config`) | `sm8550.config` |
| **Firmware Repo URL** | Git repository URL for device firmware files. | valid Git URL | `https://github.com/ianchb/sheng-firmware` |
| **Firmware Branch** | Branch to checkout from the firmware repository. | branch name | `master` |

> **Notes**  
> - To use a custom password, you **must** create a repository secret named `ROOTFS_PASSWORD` before running the workflow. The workflow maps this secret to an environment variable and uses it as the password for both the configured user and `root`.  
> - If `ROOTFS_PASSWORD` is not set, the image will still be built, but the password will fall back to the insecure default value: `password`.  
> - If you choose **Boot mode = `custom`**, you **must** fill in the **Custom partition** field.  
> - If you choose **Kernel source = `custom_build`**, you **must** provide the **Kernel Repo URL**, **Kernel Branch**, and **Kernel Config** fields.

## Flashing to Your Device

### Prerequisites

- Device with an **unlocked bootloader**.
- **TWRP** recovery installed.
- `fastboot` properly set up on your computer.

> **Warning**  
> The following steps modify device partitions and may brick your device or cause data loss. Back up your important data and make sure you understand each command.

### Partition Setup (Two Modes)

1. **Dual boot (keep existing OS)**  
   Inside TWRP, use `parted` to shrink the `userdata` partition and create a new partition at the end, named e.g. `linux`.  
   *The exact parted commands depend on your partition layout; only the concept is given here. You can refer to [alghiffaryfa19/Linux-xiaomi-sheng](https://github.com/alghiffaryfa19/Linux-xiaomi-sheng) for more information.*

2. **Single boot (replace OS completely)**  
   Use the `userdata` partition directly for Debian (erasing all previous data).

### Flashing the Images

The commands below assume:
- You will boot Debian using **slot B**
- The Debian partition is named **linux**

```bash
# 1. Erase dtbo
fastboot erase dtbo_b

# 2. Flash the boot image
fastboot flash boot_b boot.img

# 3. Flash the root filesystem to the linux partition
fastboot flash linux rootfs.img

# 4. Reboot
fastboot reboot
```

After rebooting, the device should start from slot B and boot into Debian.

## Credits

This project benefits from the following outstanding work and community support:

- **map220v** – for TWRP, the mainline kernel port and many device-specific adaptations that make Linux run on the Xiaomi Pad 6S Pro (sheng).
- **alghiffaryfa19** – for providing the original build scripts, from which this project is derived and modified.
